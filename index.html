        <p>Hi! My name is Richard. I have an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering.  After graduating from college, I pursued a carreer in IT.  My first job was an IT Programmer for a software consulting company where I worked for 2 years.  There I used Informix SQL, Informix 4GL and SQL Gupta.  Then, I took a job at Intel Manufaturing as an IT Systems Analyst and Programmer where I wrote custom reports using Powerbuilder and Crystal Reports against Oracle SQL back-end for about 2 years.  I took on various roles within Intel's IT Department ranging from individual contributor roles (Project Coordinator, Project Manager) to people manager roles (Supervisor, Section Manager). 
        </p>
        <p> From 2011 tp 2013, I worked for Accenture as an IT Project Manager where I managed between 40 to 70 technical resources composed of testers and production support specialist.  Part of my responsibility was to ensure my team meets project cost, schedule, resource, and quality needs for a major US telecomunications client.
        </p>
        <p> 
        From 2013 to 2014, I worked for IBM as an Associate IT Project Manager where I managed between 8 to 15 individuals composed of Oracle DB Administrators, SAP Security Support Analysts, and Sharepoint Administrators in support of a US medical equipment client.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2014, I left my job to move in Atlanta with my family. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I am currently a stay-at-home Dad.  My goal for this year is to complete Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp and get a job as a Web Developer or Data Analyst.
